# Fishing is Fun: Chrome Extension
A fishing buddy for your study!

## Overview

"Fishing is Fun" is a site blocker chrome extension that helps you stay on task with a fishing virtual companion that lives in your browser, 
reminders to take breaks (can set timer for breaks), task/goal list.
The more you study well, the more you will fish nice rewards! (THINK: awfully fishy fish puns.)
Fishing virtual study buddy assists you while you’re on the computer but also reminds you take screen breaks which has been a struggle in the past year.
Feeling lonely? All nighter doing an essay? Don't worry, this critter living in Chrome is always here for you.

## How is this different from other study apps?
Unlike other apps where they use gimmicky techniques that reset every study session and often have little to do other than
keeping a browser open and enforcing screen limits, "Fishing is Fun" encourages self-discipline through a cute study buddy. 
It turns studying into a fun game without any distracting separate windows. Think: Clippy but 100x better.
You also have access to all your work environment at the touch of a popup button: task list, reminders, site blocking, rewards, cute study buddy...
all in the same browser where you do your homework. There's no hassle of keeping a separate homework planner, or being unable to click off of a screen
time enforcing app. Convenient, simple, yet motivating and fun.

Ours Chrome Extension is integrated into the work environment without being distracting so you can see your productivity as you go without having to go to a new window or app.
We use more minimal movement/small icons for less distraction, but creates a satisfying “Zen” environment
Ours also implements breaks/healthy study habits
You can visually SEE a “stop time” ie. catching the fish which makes it feel like “I’ll just push myself for a bit more” and thus encourages people to try harder than a vague end goal/having no end goal of “growing plants more”.
Our reward system of “Growth” encourages more self discipline whereas other “Screen-time limiters” or “website blockers” use harsh punitive limits that don’t teach self discipline.
We moderately gamify studying with rewards to make studying fun and more productive, without being to convoluted that it's distracting.

### Feedback

If you have any comments, positive or negative, reach out to us with feedback! We'd love to hear what you think is great, and what you think we can improve.

### Credit

Credit for the extension is us. :) But we'd also like to credit Font Awesome for the logos on the buttons, and everyone for helping us learn something we've never done before:
Chrome extensions. Seriously, it was stressful (though fun).
This was our first time making a chrome extension, and we all prior had extremely limited to no knwoledge of CSS/HTML/Javascript. So, I think we should be proud of this!
